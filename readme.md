## Testing

### Responsive testing

I tested my website in the following browsers:
```
Mozilla Firefox
Google Chrome
Internet Explorer
Safari
```
The website looks good and works fine at full screen size on all of the above.

In order to test how the site looks on smaller screens I used the developer tools in Google Chrome and Firefox to simulate browsing on various devices, as well as my own Android phone and iPad. My website passes all of those tests.
